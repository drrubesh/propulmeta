Description: A user-friendly and publication-ready meta-analysis toolkit built on top of the 'meta',
    'metafor', and 'metasens' packages. Supports pooled analysis of proportions, risk/odds/hazard ratios,
    and mean differences. Includes subgroup analysis, influence diagnostics, regression, publication
    bias detection (Egger/Begg tests, contour and trim-and-fill funnel plots, limit meta-analysis,
    DOI plots), and highly customizable forest plots for both large and small meta-analyses.
